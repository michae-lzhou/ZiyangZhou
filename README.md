Hi, I’m Michael! I love learning and getting better at any chance I get, and I live by that every single day.
I’m currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at Tufts University, and I look to improve my programming
skills as well as my soft skills at any chance I get. I love programming and the tenuous process of
troubleshooting and debugging, and I find that I often learn a lot through the process of trial and error. 

Looking for internship and career opportunities! Reach me at ziyang.zhou@gmail.com or ziyang.zhou@tufts.edu
